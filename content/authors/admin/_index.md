Hi, I'm Gokce - Welcome to my computer science portfolio!

üíª I work as a software engineer at [Alida](https://www.alida.com/), a Canadian SaaS company, where we aim to deliver high quality features to our customers in a fast-paced environment, alongside creating a better company culture every day.

üéì I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in June 2022.

üçÅ I am based in Vancouver, BC, where I get to be inspired by the beauty of nature on a daily basis.

üöÄ I enjoy working on side projects, and have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, cloud computing, as well as distributed systems. I am particularly passionate about applying my computer science skills to the education technology space.

üçµ If you would like to have a chat about anything on my portfolio, please feel free to reach out to me!
