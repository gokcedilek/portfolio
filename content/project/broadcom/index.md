Timeline: May - Dec 2020

I've been working on a variety of very interesting tasks during my co-op term at Broadcom. The areas I mainly got to improve myself in include computer networking (including virtual networking), storage, bootloaders (specifically, [GRUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB)), writing Bash scripts, and last but not least, heavily using and learning about the Linux operating system and filesystem (including the [Yocto Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto_Project)). I described the major tasks that I worked on below in more detail:

# - virtual router

# - yocto build

# - partition resizing

# - grub
