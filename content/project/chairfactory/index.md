Timeline: Jan - Mar 2020

I did this project with two friends for [UBC's CPSC 304 course](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=304), and the code for our project can be found [here](https://github.com/gokcedilek/CPSC304-project).

In this project, we simulated the working of a simple chair factory. We created a web application using the [Java Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html) on the backend, with [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to host our PostgreSQL database, and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to manage our database. On the frontend, we used HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I worked on the backend of the application, specifically on implementing the API endpoints and the database queries.

Our app implements basic, as well as more complex database queries, such as [join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp), [aggregation](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-aggregate-functions/) with [group by](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp), and [division](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-division/). We are not hosting this application online, but, to run the application on your local machine, clone the project from [here](https://github.com/gokcedilek/CPSC304-project), start the application in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
