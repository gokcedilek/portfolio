Timeline: Feb 2021 - present

I am currently working on researching methods to create static call graphs for microservices-based applications using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) & [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) toolset. The aim of this project is to be able to make the call graph generation procedure framework-agnostic through the use of the common OpenAPI specifications across different Java microservices frameworks.

I will add more updates soon!
