Timeline: Dec 2020 - present

I am currently working on developing a tool to create static call graphs for microservices-based applications using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) & [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). The aim of this project is to be able to make the call graph generation procedure framework-agnostic through the use of the common OpenAPI specifications across different languages and microservices frameworks.

I will add more updates soon!
