Timeline: Feb - Mar 2021

I worked as part of a research group for a few months, where I worked with the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) toolset to explore ways of generating [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) clients for Java applications. Using the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) API, I created two applications that demonstrate how to use [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to generate OpenAPI clients for the Swagger Petstore API, and how to use the generated clients to make calls to the Swagger Petstore API.

- [Demo for Swagger Codegen CLI](https://github.com/gokcedilek/swagger-codegen-cli-demo) demonstrates how to use an OpenAPI client generated with the Swagger Codegen CLI in Java Spring Boot
- [Demo for Swagger Codegen Maven Plugin](https://github.com/gokcedilek/swagger-codegen-maven-demo) demonstrates how to use an OpenAPI client generated with the Swagger Codegen Maven plugin in Java Spring Boot
