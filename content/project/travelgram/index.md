Timeline: June - August 2021

We developed TravelGram as a trip planning web application in a team of four. Here's a breakdown of the tasks I worked on for our app:

- Creating a comprehensive form component that allows users to upload images, search for other user accounts in our app and add them to their trips as collaborators, search for a location using the Google Maps Places API, as well as customizing this component to be reused in multiple places in our app: when creating trips, trip activities, and trip templates
- Implementing trip CRUD operations, including the ability to create, edit, and delete trips, such that trip editing and deleting can only be performed by trip owners or collaborators, and a trip templating functionality that allows users to copy over certain properties from an existing trip when creating a new trip
- Creating a trip dashboard page that displays a paginated feed of userâ€™s trips via filtering the trips on the backend
- Integrating the app with Google Maps for trip visualizations, and with Firebase for image storage
- Deploying the app to Heroku through GitHub Actions
- _Technologies: React.js, Material UI, Storybook, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Heroku, GitHub Actions_
